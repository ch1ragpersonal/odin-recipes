    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish consisting of layers of flat, wide pasta sheets alternated 
        with various fillings, typically including rich meat sauces, cheeses, and sometimes vegetables. 
        The most common filling is a ragù made from ground beef or pork, tomato sauce, and aromatic herbs 
        like garlic, onions, and basil. Between these layers, creamy béchamel sauce or ricotta cheese is often
         added, providing a smooth, luscious texture. Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses are typically sprinkled 
         on top to create a golden, bubbly crust when baked. The dish is cooked in the oven until the flavours
          meld and the pasta softens, resulting in a hearty, comforting meal with a balance of savoury flavours 
          and textures. Lasagna is a versatile dish, with variations including vegetarian and seafood versions, 
          making it a popular favourite worldwide.    </p>
